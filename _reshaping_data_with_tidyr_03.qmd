# Expanding Data

Values can often be missing in your data, and sometimes entire observations are 
absent too. In this chapter, you'll learn how to complete your dataset with 
these missing observations. You'll add observations with zero values to counted 
data, expand time series to a full sequence of intervals, and more!


## Letters of the genetic code

The basic building blocks of **RNA** are four molecules described by a single
letter each: adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**), guanine (**G**), and 
uracil (**U**).
The information carried by an RNA strand can be represented as a long
sequence of these four letters. To read this code, one has to divide this chain 
into sequences of three letters each (e.g.** GCU, ACG**, â€¦). These three letter 
sequences are known as codons. The concept is illustrated in the image below.

### Instructions `100 XP` {.unnumbered}

- Create a tibble with three columns called `letter1`, `letter2`, and `letter3`
that holds all possible combinations of the vector letters using 
`expand_grid()`.

```{.r filename="ex_019.R"}
letters <- c("A", "C", "G", "U")
# Create a tibble with all possible 3 way combinations
codon_df <- expand_grid(
    leter1 = letters,
    leter2 = letters,
    leter3 = letters
)
codon_df
```
