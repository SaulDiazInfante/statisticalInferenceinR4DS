# Left and Right Joins

Learn two more mutating joins, the left and right join, which are mirror images
of each other! You'll learn use cases for each type of join as you explore
parts and colors of LEGO themes. Then, you'll explore how to join tables to
themselves to understand the hierarchy of LEGO themes in the data.
