# Introduction

Often in data science, you'll encounter fascinating data that is spread across 
multiple tables. This course will teach you the skills you'll need to join 
multiple tables together to analyze them in combination. You'll practice your 
skills using a fun dataset about LEGOs from the Rebrickable website. The dataset
contains information about the sets, parts, themes, and colors of LEGOs, but is
spread across many tables. You'll work with the data throughout the course as 
you learn a total of six different joins! You'll learn four mutating joins:
inner join, left join, right join, and full join, and two filtering joins:
semi join and anti join. In the final chapter, you'll apply your new skills 
to Stack Overflow data, containing each of the almost 300,000 Stack Oveflow
questions that are tagged with R, including information about their answers, 
the date they were asked, and their score. Get ready to take your dplyr skills 
to the next level!
