# Case Study: Joins on Stack Overflow Data

Put together all the types of join you learned in this course to analyze a new
dataset: Stack Overflow questions, answers, and tags. This includes calculating
and visualizing trends for some notable tags like `dplyr` and `ggplot2`. You'll 
also master one more method for combining tables, the bind_rows verb, which 
stacks tables on top of each other.
