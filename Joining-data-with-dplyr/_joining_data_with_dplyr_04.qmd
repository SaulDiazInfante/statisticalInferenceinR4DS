# Case Study: Joins on Stack Overflow Data

Put together all the types of join you learned in this course to analyze a new
dataset: Stack Overflow questions, answers, and tags. This includes calculating
and visualizing trends for some notable tags like `dplyr` and `ggplot2`. You'll 
also master one more method for combining tables, the bind_rows verb, which 
stacks tables on top of each other.

## Left joining questions and tags

Three of the Stack Overflow survey datasets are `questions`, 
`question_tags`, and `tags`:

- `questions`: an ID and the score, or how many times the question has been 
upvoted; the data only includes R-based questions
- `question_tags`: a tag ID for each question and the question's id
- `tags`: a tag id and the tag's name, which can be used to identify the subject
 of each question, such as `ggplot2` or `dplyr`

In this exercise, we'll be stitching together these datasets and replacing 
NAs in important fields.

Note that we'll be using `left_joins` in this exercise to ensure we keep all 
questions, even those without a corresponding tag. However, since we know the 
`questions` data is all R data, we'll want to manually tag these as R questions
with `replace_na`.

Join together `questions` and `question_tags` using the `id` and 
`question_id` columns, respectively.

```{.r filename=ex_025.R}
# Join the questions and question_tags tables
questions %>%
  left_join(
    question_tags,
    by = c("id" = "question_id")
  )
# Join in the tags table
questions %>%
  left_join(
    question_tags,
    by = c("id" = "question_id")
  ) %>%
  left_join(
    tags,
    by = c("tag_id" = "id")
  )

  # Replace the NAs in the tag_name column
questions %>%
  left_join(
    question_tags,
    by = c("id" = "question_id")
  ) %>%
  left_join(
    tags,
    by = c("tag_id" = "id")
  ) %>%
  replace_na(
    list(tag_name = "only-r")
  )
