# Data frames

## What's a data frame?
You may remember from the chapter about matrices that all the elements that you
put in a matrix should be of the same type. Back then, your dataset on Star Wars 
only contained numeric elements.

When doing a market research survey, however, you often have questions such as:

- 'Are you married?' or 'yes/no' questions (logical)
- 'How old are you?' (numeric)
- 'What is your opinion on this product?' or other 'open-ended' questions  
(character)
- â€¦
The output, namely the respondents' answers to the questions formulated above,
is a dataset of different data types. You will often find yourself working with
datasets that contain different data types instead of only one.

A data frame has the variables of a dataset as columns and the observations as 
rows. This will be a familiar concept for those coming from different 
statistical software packages such as SAS or SPSS.
