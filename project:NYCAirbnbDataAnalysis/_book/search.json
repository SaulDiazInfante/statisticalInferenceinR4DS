You will also use your string cleaning and date manipulation skills to extract accurate information from the datasets. The packages and tools used here are utilized by data scientists everyday since so much of the world’s data is stored in unconventional formats and is not clean or analysis-ready."

You’ll examine this data to answer the following questions, but you’ll need to combine the different files from your three sources into one dataset and clean it in order to calculate the metrics you’re interested in.\nYour questions are as follows:\n\nWhat is the average listing price? Save your answer as a numeric variable, avg_price.\nHow many of the listings are private rooms? Save your answer as a numeric variable called nb_private_rooms.\n\nWhen were the earliest and most recent reviews in the dataset? Save these as Dates in a tibble called review_dates. It should contain two columns named first_reviewed, which contains the earliest date in the dataset, and last_reviewed, which contains the latest date in the dataset."
