#  Airbnb listings in New York City

Welcome to New York City, one of the most-visited cities in the world.
As a result, there are many Airbnb listings in New York City to meet the high
demand for temporary lodging for anywhere between a few nights to many months.
In this notebook, we will take a closer look at the New York Airbnb market
by combining data from multiple file types like `.csv`, `.tsv`, and `.xlsx`
(Excel files).

A **CSV**, or comma-separated-values, file is one of the most common ways that 
tabular data is stored. In a CSV file, each value is separated by a comma and
each row is separated by a newline. Since this file format is so widely used 
and is non-proprietary, it's great for sharing data with others and can be 
parsed by a variety of software. 

```{.r code-line-numbers="false"}
"listing_id","price","nbhood_full"
2595,"225 dollars","Manhattan, Midtown"
3831,"89 dollars","Brooklyn, Clinton Hill"
5099,"200 dollars","Manhattan, Murray Hill"    
```

A **TSV**, or tab-separated-values, file is similar to a CSV file, but tabs are used 
to separate values rather than commas:

```{.r code-line-numbers="false"}
listing_id    host_name   last_review
2595    Jennifer    May 21 2019
3831    LisaRoxanne July 05 2019
5099    Chris   June 22 2019
```

**Excel files** are often used by spreadsheet users. Excel files contain 
information about formatting and formulas created in Excel, but these things 
aren't usually necessary when working with data in R. Excel files can also 
contain multiple tables, so these files need to be imported carefully to make 
sure the correct table is used. The Excel file format is also proprietary, so 
there's a more limited pool of software that can read it.

The three files that are available contain data on 2019 Airbnb listings.
Here are the details:

Airbnbs.

listing_id

Note
: This project lets you apply the skills from the Importing and 
Cleaning Data with R skill track, including importing from different file 
types and cleaning numerical, categorical, and date data. 
We recommend that you take the courses in this track before starting this 
project.


## Introduction {.unnumbered}

In this project, you will apply your data importing and cleaning skills to 
uncover insights about the Airbnb market in New York City.

You will import data from multiple file types and combine them to answer 
questions about the Airbnb market in New York. You will also use your string
cleaning and date manipulation skills to extract accurate information from
the datasets. The packages and tools used here are utilized by data scientists
everyday since so much of the world's data is stored in unconventional formats
and is not clean or analysis-ready.

## Instructions

You are a consultant working for a real estate start-up and have been asked
to look into the short-term rental market in New York, so you've gathered
Airbnb listing data from several different sources. You'll examine this data
to answer the following questions, but you'll need to combine the different
files from your three sources into one dataset and clean it in order to
 calculate the metrics you're interested in.

Your questions are as follows:

- **What is the average listing price?** Save your answer as a numeric variable,
`avg_price`.

- **How many of the listings are private rooms?** Save your answer as a numeric
variable called nb_private_rooms.

**When were the earliest and most recent reviews in the dataset?** 
Save these as Dates in a tibble called `review_dates`. It should contain two 
columns named `first_reviewed`, which contains the earliest date in the dataset,
and `last_reviewed`, which contains the latest date in the dataset.
