Data in the wild can be scary—when confronted with a complicated and messy 
dataset you may find yourself wondering, where do I even start? 
The `tidyr` package allows you to wrangle such beasts into nice and tidy 
datasets. Inaccessible values stored in column names will be put into rows,
JSON files will become data frames, and missing values will never go missing
again. You'll practice these techniques on a wide range of messy datasets,
learning along the way how many dogs the Soviet Union sent into space and
what bird is most popular in New Zealand. With the tidyr package in your 
tidyverse toolkit, you'll be able to transform almost any dataset in a tidy
format which will pay-off during the rest of your analysis.
