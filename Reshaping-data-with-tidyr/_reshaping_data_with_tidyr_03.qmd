# Expanding Data

Values can often be missing in your data, and sometimes entire observations are 
absent too. In this chapter, you'll learn how to complete your dataset with 
these missing observations. You'll add observations with zero values to counted 
data, expand time series to a full sequence of intervals, and more!


## Letters of the genetic code

The basic building blocks of **RNA** are four molecules described by a single
letter each: adenine (**A**), cytosine (**C**), guanine (**G**), and 
uracil (**U**).
The information carried by an RNA strand can be represented as a long
sequence of these four letters. To read this code, one has to divide this chain 
into sequences of three letters each (e.g.** GCU, ACG**, â€¦). These three letter 
sequences are known as codons. The concept is illustrated in the image below.

### Instructions `100 XP` {.unnumbered}

- Create a tibble with three columns called `letter1`, `letter2`, and `letter3`
that holds all possible combinations of the vector letters using 
`expand_grid()`.
- Use the `unite()` function from chapter one to merge these three columns into 
a single column named codon. Use an empty string as the separator.

```{.r filename="ex_019.R"}
letters <- c("A", "C", "G", "U")
# Create a tibble with all possible 3 way combinations
codon_df <- expand_grid(
    leter1 = letters,
    leter2 = letters,
    leter3 = letters
)
codon_df

letters <- c("A", "C", "G", "U")
# Create a tibble with all possible 3 way combinations
codon_df <- expand_grid(
  letter1 = letters,
  letter2 = letters,
  letter3 = letters
)
#
codon_df %>% 
  # Unite these three columns into a "codon" column
  unite("codon",  c(letter1, letter2, letter3),
    sep = ''
  )
```

## When did humans replace dogs in space

You already know that in the early days of spaceflight, the USSR was testing
rockets with dogs. You now wonder when exactly humans started replacing dogs on
space flight missions. You've been given a dataset `space_df` with the number
of both dogs (compiled by Duncan Geere) and humans in space per year from 1951
till 1970 (collected from Wikipedia).

Your goal is to create a plot that shows you the number of individuals sent
into space per species. Before you can create this plot, you'll first have to
introduce zero values for missing combinations of `year` and `species`.

Load dplyr and ggplot2 packages.

### Instructions `100 XP` {.unnumbered}
- Create `full_df`, a tibble with all unique combinations of the variables year 
(from 1951 to 1970) and `species` (`"Human"` and `"Dog"`).
- Perform a `right_join()` between `space_df` and `full_df` on the `year` and
species columns.
- Use the ggplot() function to create a line plot of n_in_space over year,
colored by species.
- Use the replace_na() function to overwrite NA values in the n_in_space 
column with zeros.

```{.r filename="ex_020.R"}
# Create a tibble with all combinations of years and species
full_df <- expand_grid(
  year = 1951:1970, 
  species = c("Human", "Dog")
)

space_df %>% 
  # Join with full_df so that missing values are introduced
  right_join(full_df, by = c("year", "species")) %>% 
  # Create a line plot with n_in_space over year, color by species
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = n_in_space,
      y = year,
      group = species,
      color = species
    )
  ) +
  geom_line()
# Create a tibble with all combinations of years and species
full_df <- expand_grid(
  year = 1951:1970, 
  species = c("Human", "Dog")
)

space_df %>% 
  # Join with full_df so that missing values are introduced
  right_join(full_df, by = c("year", "species")) %>% 
  # Overwrite NA values for n_in_space with 0L
  replace_na(list(n_in_space = 0L)) %>% 
  # Create a line plot with n_in_space over year, color by species
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n_in_space, color = species)) +
  geom_line()

```

## Finding missing observations

You're an inspector at a nuclear plant and have to validate whether every 
reactor has received its daily safety check over the course of a full year.
The safety check logs are in `reactor_df`, a data frame with columns date,
reactor, and check.

Two vectors, `dates` and `reactors`, with all dates of the year and reactors at
the plant respectively have been created for you. You'll use the combination of
the `expand_grid()` and `anti_join()` functions to find dates where 
particular reactors were not checked.

Load `dplyr` package.

### Instructions `100 XP` {.unnumbered}
- Use the `expand_grid()` function to create a tibble holding all combinations
of the variables date and reactor.  Use the dates and reactors vectors created
for you.
- Perform an anti-join between f`ull_df` and `reactor_df` on the date and 
reactor columns.


```{.r filename="ex_021.R"}
# Create a tibble with all combinations of dates and reactors
full_df <- expand_grid(
  date = dates, 
  reactor = reactors
)

# Find the reactor - date combinations not present in reactor_df
full_df %>% 
  anti_join(reactor_df, by=c("date", "reactor"))
```
## Completing the Solar System
You have been given a data frame (`planet_df`) from the 
[devstronomy](https://devstronomy.com/#/datasets)
project with the number of moons per planet in our Solar System.
However, Mercury and Venus, the two moonless planets, are absent.
You want to expand this dataset using the `complete()` function and a 
vector `planets` that contains all eight planet's names.

### Instructions `100 XP` {.unnumbered}

- Complete the `planet` variable using the `planets` vector.
- Replace `NA` values in the `n_moons` variable with `0L` values.

```{.r filename="ex_022.R"}
planets = c(
    "Mercury",
    "Venus",
    "Earth",
    "Mars",
    "Jupiter",
    "Saturn",
    "Uranus",
    "Neptune"
)

planet_df %>% 
  complete(
    # Complete the planet variable
    planet =  planets,
    # Overwrite NA values for n_moons with 0L
    fill= list(n_moons = 0L)
  )

```
## Zero Olymoic medals

Since 1896, athletes from all over the world have been competing in the modern 
Olympic games. You've been given a dataset (`medal_df`) with observations for 
all medals won by athletes from the 10 most successful countries in Olympic 
history. You want to create a visual with the number of medals won per country
(`team`) per `year`. However, since not all countries won medals each year,
you'll have to introduce zero values before you can make an accurate visual.

![](olympic_flag_large.png)
Load `ggplot2` and `dplyr`. 
In step 2 and 3 the `scale_color_brewer()` function is used to color lines in 
the plot with a palette that makes it easier to distinguish the different
countries.

### Instructions `100 XP` {.unnumbered}

- Count the number of medals won per team and year.
- Use `ggplot()` to create a line plot with `n_medals` over `year`, colored 
by team.
- Complete the `team` and `year` variables, replace `NA` values in the 
`n_medals` column with zeros.

```{.r filename="ex_023.R"}
medal_df %>% 
  # Count the medals won per team and year
  count(team, year, name = "n_medals")
medal_df %>% 
  # Count the medals won per team and year
  count(team, year, name = "n_medals") %>% 
  # Plot n_medals over year, colored by team
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = year,
      y = n_medals,
      group = team,
      color = team
    )
  ) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Paired")

medal_df %>% 
  # Count the medals won per team and year
  count(team, year, name = "n_medals") %>% 
  # Complete the team and year variables, fill n_medals with zeros
  complete(
    team,
    year,
    fill = list(n_medals = 0)
  ) %>% 
  # Plot n_medals over year, colored by team
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n_medals, color = team)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Paired")

```
## Creating a sequence with full_seq()

The `full_seq()` function will look for the minimal and maximal values inside
the vector you pass it and will then generate a full sequence of numbers with a
fixed period in between them. When used inside the `complete()` function,
`full_seq()` is a handy tool to make sure there are no missing observations
in your data. Before combining these two functions you'll generate a few 
sequences with `full_seq()` on its own to get the hang of this function.

### Instructions `100 XP` {.unnumbered}

- Use `full_seq()` to create a sequence with all years from 2020 till 2030.
- Use full_seq() to create a sequence with all decades from 1980 till 2030.
- Use full_seq() to create a sequence with all dates in 1980 using the 
outer_dates vector.


```{.r filename="ex_024.R"}
# Generate all years from 2020 to 2030
years <- full_seq(c(2020, 2030), period = 1)
years
# Generate all decades from 1980 to 2030
decades <- full_seq(c(1980, 2030), period = 10)
decades

outer_dates <- c(as.Date("1980-01-01"), as.Date("1980-12-31"))
# Generate the dates for all days in 1980
full_seq(outer_dates, period = 1)

```

## The Cold War's hottest year

In October 1962, during the Cuban missile crisis, the world came close to a full
scale nuclear war. Throughout 1962, the USA, USSR, and France together detonated
a record 178 nuclear bombs for military power display and research.
You've been given a sample of the Nuclear Explosion Database (NEDB) for that 
year (`cumul_nukes_1962_df`) with an observation for each date on which a bomb
was detonated. The `total_bombs` variable contains the cumulative number of
bombs detonated by a country up to that point in time.

You'll complete the dataset to hold the full sequence of dates, and visualize
the total number of bombs per country over time. You'll also use the `fill()`
function from Chapter One to impute missing values.

Load dplyr and ggplot2 packages.

### Instructions `100 XP` {.unnumbered}
- Complete the dataset so that for each `country` there is an observation of each 
date using the `full_seq()` function.

```{.r filename="ex_026.R"}

cumul_nukes_1962_df %>% 
  # Complete the dataset
  complete(
    country,
    date = full_seq(date, period = 1) 
  )

cumul_nukes_1962_df %>% 
  # Complete the dataset
  complete(country, date = full_seq(date, period = 1)) %>% 
  # Group the data by country
  group_by(country) %>% 
  # Impute missing values with the last known observation
  fill(total_bombs)
cumul_nukes_1962_df %>% 
  # Complete the dataset
    complete(country, date = full_seq(date, period = 1)) %>% 
  # Group the data by country
    group_by(country) %>% 
  # Impute missing values with the last known observation
    fill(total_bombs) %>% 
  # Plot the number of bombs over time, color by country
    ggplot(
        aes(
        x = date,
        y = total_bombs,
        group = country,
        color = country
        )
    ) +
  # These two lines will mark the Cuban Missile Crisis 
    geom_rect(
        xmin = as.Date("1962-10-16"),
        xmax = as.Date("1962-10-29"),
        ymin = -Inf,
        ymax = Inf,
        color = NA) + 
    geom_text(
        x = as.Date("1962-10-22"),
        y = 15, label = "Cuban Missile Crisis",
        angle = 90,
        color = "white"
    ) +
  geom_line()

```
## Olympic medals per continent

You want to compare Olympic performance of athletes per continent over time,
both on the winter and summer Olympics. You've been given a dataset `medal_df` 
with the average number of medals won per participant of each continent since 
1928 . You'll complete this data to introduce zero values for years where a
continent did not win any medals.

The `ggplot2` package has been pre-loaded for you.

### Instructions `100 XP` {.unnumbered}

- Complete the dataset so that each continent has a `medals_per_participant` 
value at each Olympic event. Missing values should be filled with zeros.

- Nest the season and year variables using the `nesting()` function, since the
summer and winter Olympics don't occur in the same years.

- Use `ggplot()` to create a line plot with the `medals_per_participant` per 
year, color the plot by continent.

```{.r filename="ex_026.R"}
medal_df %>% 
  # Give each continent an observation at each Olympic event
  complete(
    continent,
    nesting(season, year),  
    fill = list(medals_per_participant = 0L)
  ) %>%
  # Plot the medals_per_participant over time, colored by continent
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = year,
      y = medals_per_participant,
      group(continent),
      color = continent
    )
  ) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(season ~ .)
```
## Tracking a virus outbreak

You're a doctor in a remote village confronted with a virus outbreak.
You have been collecting data on when your patients got infected and recovered
in a data frame named `patient_df`. Your goal is to create a visual with the
number of sick patients over time. You'll first have to reshape the data so 
that you can count the number of sick patients per day.

The data frame has three columns: `patient`, `infected`, and `recovered`.
The `dplyr` and `ggplot2` packages have been pre-loaded for you.

### Instructions `100 XP` {.unnumbered}

- Pivot the `infected` and recovered columns to long format, the old column
names should go in the `status` variable, the values to `date`.

- Group the data by patient and then complete the date column so that each date
between infection and recovery is added using the `full_seq()` column. At the 
end, ungroup the data.

```{.r filename="ex_027.R"}

patient_df %>% 
  # Pivot the infected and recovered columns to long format
  pivot_longer(
    -patient,
    names_to = "status",
    values_to = "date"
  )

patient_df %>% 
  # Pivot the infected and recovered columns to long format
  pivot_longer(-patient, names_to = "status", values_to = "date") %>% 
  select(-status) %>% 
  # Group by patient
  group_by(patient) %>% 
  # Complete the date range per patient using full_seq()
  complete(date = full_seq(date, period = 1)) %>% 
  # Ungroup the data
  ungroup()

patient_df %>% 
  # Pivot the infected and recovered columns to long format
  pivot_longer(-patient, names_to = "status", values_to = "date") %>% 
  select(-status) %>% 
  # Group by patient
  group_by(patient) %>% 
  # Complete the date range per patient using full_seq()
  complete(date = full_seq(date, period = 1)) %>% 
  # Ungroup the data
  ungroup()

```
## Counting office occupants

Imagine you're an office facility manager and want to know how many people are
present throughout the day. You've installed a sensor at the entrance that
counts the number of people entering and leaving the building. The sensor sends
an update at the end of every 20 minute time slot if at least one person passed.

To create a dataset ready for visualization, you'll combine the different
techniques you've learned so far.

Load `dplyr` and `ggplot2` packages.

### Instructions `100 XP` {.unnumbered}
- Complete the time variable by using the `seq()` function to create a sequence
between the min and max values with an interval of "20 min". 
Fill NA values of enter and exit with 0L.

```{.r filename="ex_028.R"}
sensor_df %>% 
  # Complete the time column with a 20 minute interval
  complete(time = seq(min(time), max(time), by = "20 min"),
           fill = list(enter = 0L, exit = 0L)) %>%
  # Calculate the total number of people inside
  mutate(total_inside = cumsum(enter + exit)) %>% 
  # Pivot the enter and exit columns to long format
  pivot_longer(enter:exit, names_to = "direction", values_to = "n_people") %>% 
  # Plot the number of people over time, fill by direction
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x =time, 
      y = n_people, 
      fill = direction
    )
  ) +
  geom_area() +
  geom_line(aes(y = total_inside))

```
