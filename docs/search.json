My Background is related with numerical analysis and stochastic models. I’m are a enthusiastic of this treading topic called Data-Science, but perhaps at the moment I only have just intuition about what really it is. However, I have been programming almost 20 years an moved from old programming langues as FORTRAN, Pascal, Basic, Cobol, C, C++ to the new well established treading development workflows like R, Python and Julia. This is my firs attempt in R.\nMore of this book is work in progress. We aim to provide material as well we review and improve our basic skills to face the study of the most popular methods in Machine learning. Thus the book try to cover fundamentals in R programming as data types, flow control structures and put particular importance in the well practice of coding functions. Then we moves to the management of data whit dplyr and other packages. To finish this part we discuss some package to visualize data. Then, we face the problem o estimation and explore techniques based on bootstrap–and another sampling flavors.\nThis book has been started on January, 2023 as part of a course to the Master on Data Science from Universidad de Sonora.\nI’m writing this book to follow a path of self learning, understanding and and joy for this matter called Data Science. I’m not try to become and expert instead I just pursuit the joy of the interaction of math, computational sciences and the generosity of this virtuous learning-teaching process.\nhttps://sauldiazinfante.github.io/statisticalInferenceinR4DS/"

    "text": "What we mean when say “better coding practice”\nR programmers have a bad reputation writing bad code. Perhaps the main reason is that the people whose write much of the package are not programmers but scientific from other areas. Sometimes we overestimate crucial aspects from a programming standpoint. As R programmers we overcome to write the code for production. Mostly we write scripts and when we deploy it the same when we just wrap it in a function and perhaps a package. It is common to face poorly written code—columns were referred by numbers, functions were dependent upon global environment variables, 50+ lines functions without arguments and with over-sized lines code 100 characters or more, not indentation, poor naming, conventions etc,…,.\nWe strongly encourage to use a style. Yea I know, there is not a unique way to do it, but the philosophy is to follow a consistent style. With respect to this regard made yourself a favor and read this great book for R\nhttps://bookdown.org/content/d1e53ac9-28ce-472f-bc2c-f499f18264a3/"

Vectors are one-dimension arrays that can hold numeric data, character data, or logical data. In other words, a vector is a simple tool to store data. For example, you can store your daily gains and losses in the casinos.\nIn R, you create a vector with the combine function c().

Understanding what each element refers to is therefore essential.\nIn the previous exercise, we created a vector with your winnings over the week. Each vector element refers to a day of the week but it is hard to tell which element belongs to which day. It would be nice if you could show that in the vector itself.\nYou can give a name to the elements of a vector with the names() function.

When you work with (extremely) large datasets and data frames, your first task as a data analyst is to develop a clear understanding of its structure and main elements. Therefore, it is often useful to show only a small part of the entire dataset.\nSo how to do this in R? Well, the function head() enables you to show the first observations of a data frame. Similarly, the function tail() prints out the last observations in your dataset.\nBoth head() and tail() print a top line called the ‘header’, which contains the names of the different variables in your dataset.\nInstructions 100 XP\n\nCall head() on the mtcars dataset to have a look at the header and the first observations.\n\n\nex_42.R\n\n# Call head() on mtcars\nhead(mtcars)"

According to your good friend Buzz, the main features of a planet are:\n\nThe type of planet (Terrestrial or Gas Giant).\nThe planet’s diameter relative to the diameter of the Earth.\nThe planet’s rotation across the sun relative to that of the Earth.\nIf the planet has rings or not (TRUE or FALSE).\n\nAfter doing some high-quality research on Wikipedia, you feel confident enough to create the necessary vectors: name, type, diameter, rotation and rings; these vectors have already been coded up in the editor. The first element in each of these vectors correspond to the first observation.\nYou construct a data frame with the data.frame() function. As arguments, you pass the vectors from before: they will become the different columns of your data frame. Because every column has the same length, the vectors you pass should also have the same length. But don’t forget that it is possible (and likely) that they contain different types of data.\nInstructions 100 XP\n\nUse the function data.frame() to construct a data frame.

    "text": "6.6 Selecting elements from a list\nYour list will often be built out of numerous elements and components. Therefore, getting a single element, multiple elements, or a component out of it is not always straightforward.\nOne way to select a component is using the numbered position of that component. For example, to “grab” the first component of shining_list you type\nshining_list[[1]]\nA quick way to check this out is typing it in the console. Important to remember: to select elements from vectors, you use single square brackets: [ ]. Don’t mix them up!\nYou can also refer to the names of the components, with [[ ]] or with the $ sign. Both will select the data frame representing the reviews:\nshining_list[[\"reviews\"]]\nshining_list$reviews\nBesides selecting components, you often need to select specific elements out of these components. For example, with shining_list[[2]][1] you select from the second component, actors (shining_list[[2]]), the first element ([1]). When you type this in the console, you will see the answer is Jack Nicholson.\n\n6.6.1 Instructions 100 XP\n\nSelect from shining_list the vector representing the actors.

Finally, call the interpret() function twice: on the first value of the linkedin vector and on the second element of the facebook vector.\n\n\n\nex_029.R\n\n# The linkedin and facebook vectors have already been created for you\n\n# Define the interpret function\ninterpret <- function(num_views) {\nif (num_views > 15) {\n  print(\"You're popular!\")\n  return(num_views)\n} else {\n  print(\"Try to be more visible!\")\n  return(0)\n}\n}\n\n# Call the interpret function twice\ninterpret(linkedin[1])\ninterpret(facebook[1])"

In this exercise you’ll be writing another function that will use the interpret() function to interpret all the data from your daily profile views inside a vector. Furthermore, your function will return the sum of views on popular days, if asked for. A for loop is ideal for iterating over all the vector elements. The ability to return the sum of views on popular days is something you can code through a function argument with a default value.\n\n8.12.1 Instructions 100 XP\nFinish the template for the interpret_all() function:\n\nMake return_sum an optional argument, that is TRUE by default.\nInside the for loop, iterate over all views: on every iteration, add the result of interpret(v) to count. Remember that interpret(v) returns v for popular days, and 0 otherwise. At the same time, interpret(v) will also do some printouts.\nFinish the if construct:\nIf return_sum is TRUE, return count.\nElse, return NULL.\n\nCall this newly defined function on both linkedin and facebook.\n\n\nex_029.R\n\n# The linkedin and facebook vectors have already been created for you\nlinkedin <- c(16, 9, 13, 5, 2, 17, 14)\nfacebook <- c(17, 7, 5, 16, 8, 13, 14)\n\n# The interpret() can be used inside interpret_all()\ninterpret <- function(num_views) {\nif (num_views > 15) {\n  print(\"You're popular!\")\n  return(num_views)\n} else {\n  print(\"Try to be more visible!\")\n  return(0)\n}\n}\n\n# Define the interpret_all() function\n# views: vector with data to interpret\n# return_sum: return total number of views on popular days?\ninterpret_all <- function(views, return_sum = TRUE) {\ncount <- 0\n\nfor (v in views) {\n  count <- count + interpret(v)\n}\n\nif (return_sum) {\n  return (count)\n} else {\n  return (NULL)\n}\n}\n\n# Call the interpret_all() function on both linkedin and facebook\n\ninterpret_all(linkedin)\ninterpret_all(facebook)"

    "text": "8.13 Load an R Package\nThere are basically two extremely important functions when it comes down to R packages:\n\ninstall.packages(), which as you can expect, installs a given package.\nlibrary() which loads packages, i.e. attaches them to the search list on your R workspace.\n\nTo install packages, you need administrator privileges. This means that install.packages() will thus not work in the DataCamp interface. However, almost all CRAN packages are installed on our servers. You can load them with library().\nIn this exercise, you’ll be learning how to load the ggplot2 package, a powerful package for data visualization. You’ll use it to create a plot of two variables of the mtcars data frame. The data has already been prepared for you in the workspace.\nBefore starting, execute the following commands in the console:\n\nsearch(), to look at the currently attached packages and\nqplot(mtcars\\(wt, mtcars\\)hp), to build a plot of two variables of the mtcars data frame. An error should occur, because you haven’t loaded the ggplot2 package yet!\n\n\nInstructions 100 XP\n\nTo fix the error you saw in the console, load the ggplot2 package. Make sure you are loading (and not installing) the package!\nNow, retry calling the qplot() function with the same arguments.\nFinally, check out the currently attached packages again.\n\n\n\nex_030.R\n\n# Load the ggplot2 package\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Retry the qplot() function\nqplot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$hp)\n\n# Check out the currently attached packages again\nsearch()"
