We want to show you the\n\"whole game\" of data science giving you just enough of all the major pieces so\nthat you can tackle real, if simple, data sets. The later parts of the book,\nwill hit each of these topics in more depth, increasing the range of data\nscience challenges that you can tackle.\n",
