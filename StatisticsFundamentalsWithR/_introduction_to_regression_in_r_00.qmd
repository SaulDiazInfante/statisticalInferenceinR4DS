# Introduction to Regression in R: part description {.unnumbered}
> Linear regression and logistic regression are 
thetwo most widely used statistical models and act > 
like master keys, unlocking the secrets hidden in 
datasets. In this course, you’ll gain the skills 
you need to fit simple linear and logistic 
regressions.  Through hands-on exercises, you’ll 
explore the relationships between variables in real-
world  datasets, including motor insurance claims, 
Taiwan house prices, fish sizes, and more. By the end 
of this course, you’ll know how to make predictions 
from your data, quantify model performance, and 
diagnose problems with model fit.
