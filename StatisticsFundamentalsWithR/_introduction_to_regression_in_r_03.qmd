# Assessing model fit

In this chapter, you’ll learn how to ask questions of 
your model to assess fit. You’ll learn how to 
quantify how well a linear regression model fits, 
diagnose model problems using visualizations, and 
understand the leverage and influence of each 
observation used to create the model.
