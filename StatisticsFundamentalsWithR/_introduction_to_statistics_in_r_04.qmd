# Correlation and Experimental Design

In this chapter, you'll learn how to quantify the strength of a linear
relationship between two variables, and explore how confounding variables
can affect the relationship between two other variables. You'll also see 
how a studyâ€™s design can influence its results, change how the data should
be analyzed, and potentially affect the reliability of your conclusions.

## Relationships between variables


In this chapter, you'll be working with a dataset `world_happiness` 
containing results from the 2019 World Happiness Report.
The report scores various countries based on how happy people in that country
are. It also ranks each country on various societal aspects such as social
support, freedom, corruption, and others. The dataset also includes the 
GDP per capita and life expectancy for each country.

In this exercise, you'll examine the relationship between a country's life 
expectancy `(life_exp)` and happiness score `(happiness_score)` both visually
and quantitatively. Both dplyr and `ggplot2` are loaded and `world_happiness`
is available.

### Instructions `100 XP`
- Create a scatterplot of happiness_score vs. life_exp using ggplot2
- Add a linear trendline to the scatterplot, setting se to FALSE.
```{.r filename=ex_023.R}
# Create a scatterplot of happiness_score vs. life_exp
world_happiness %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = life_exp, y = happiness_score )) + 
        geom_point()
# Add a linear trendline to scatterplot
ggplot(world_happiness, aes(life_exp, happiness_score)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method ="lm", se =FALSE)
cor(
  world_happiness$life_exp,
  world_happiness$happiness_score
)
```

## What can't correlation measure?

While the correlation coefficient is a convenient way to quantify the
strength of a relationship between two variables, it's far from perfect. 
In this exercise, you'll explore one of the caveats of the correlation
coefficient by examining the relationship between a country's GDP per 
capita `(gdp_per_cap)` and happiness score.

Both `dplyr` and `ggplot2` are loaded and `world_happiness` is available.

### Instructions `100 XP`
Create a scatterplot showing the relationship between
gdp_per_cap (on the x-axis) and life_exp (on the y-axis).

```{.r filename=ex_024.R}
# Scatterplot of gdp_per_cap and life_exp
world_happiness %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = gdp_per_cap, y = life_exp)) +
    geom_point()
cor(world_happiness$gdp_per_cap,
  world_happiness$life_exp
)

```

## Transforming variables
When variables have skewed distributions, they often require a transformation 
in order to form a linear relationship with another variable so that 
correlation can be computed. In this exercise, you'll perform a transformation 
yourself.

Both `dplyr` and `ggplot2` are loaded and `world_happiness` is available.
### Instructions `100 XP`

```{.r filename=ex_025.R}
# Scatterplot of happiness_score vs. gdp_per_cap
world_happiness %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = gdp_per_cap, y = happiness_score)) + 
    geom_point()

# Calculate correlation
cor(world_happiness$happiness_score, 
world_happiness$gdp_per_cap)
# Create log_gdp_per_cap column
world_happiness <- world_happiness %>%
  mutate(log_gdp_per_cap = log(gdp_per_cap))

# Scatterplot of happiness_score vs. log_gdp_per_cap
ggplot(world_happiness,
  aes(
    x = log_gdp_per_cap,
    y = happiness_score)
  ) +
  geom_point()

# Calculate correlation
cor(
  world_happiness$log_gdp_per_cap,
  world_happiness$happiness_score
)
```
## Does sugar improve happiness?

A new column has been added to `world_happiness` called 
`grams_sugar_per_day`, which contains the average amount of sugar 
eaten per person per day in each country. In this exercise, you'll
examine the effect of a country's average sugar consumption on its
happiness score.

Both `dplyr` and `ggplot2` are loaded and `world_happiness` is available.
### Instructions `100 XP`
```{.r filename=ex_026.R}
# Scatterplot of grams_sugar_per_day and happiness_score
world_happiness %>%
    ggplot(
        aes(
            x = grams_sugar_per_day,
            y = happiness_score
            
        )
    )+ 
        geom_point()

# Correlation between grams_sugar_per_day and happiness_score
cor(
    world_happiness$happiness_score, 
    world_happiness$grams_sugar_per_day
)
```
