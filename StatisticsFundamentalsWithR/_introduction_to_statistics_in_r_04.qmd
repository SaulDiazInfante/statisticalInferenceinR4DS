# Correlation and Experimental Design

In this chapter, you'll learn how to quantify the strength of a linear
relationship between two variables, and explore how confounding variables
can affect the relationship between two other variables. You'll also see 
how a studyâ€™s design can influence its results, change how the data should
be analyzed, and potentially affect the reliability of your conclusions.

## Relationships between variables


In this chapter, you'll be working with a dataset `world_happiness` 
containing results from the 2019 World Happiness Report.
The report scores various countries based on how happy people in that country
are. It also ranks each country on various societal aspects such as social
support, freedom, corruption, and others. The dataset also includes the 
GDP per capita and life expectancy for each country.

In this exercise, you'll examine the relationship between a country's life 
expectancy `(life_exp)` and happiness score `(happiness_score)` both visually
and quantitatively. Both dplyr and `ggplot2` are loaded and `world_happiness`
is available.

### Instructions `100 XP`
- Create a scatterplot of happiness_score vs. life_exp using ggplot2
- Add a linear trendline to the scatterplot, setting se to FALSE.
```{.r filename=ex_023.R}
# Create a scatterplot of happiness_score vs. life_exp
world_happiness %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = life_exp, y = happiness_score )) + 
        geom_point()
# Add a linear trendline to scatterplot
ggplot(world_happiness, aes(life_exp, happiness_score)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method ="lm", se =FALSE)
cor(
  world_happiness$life_exp,
  world_happiness$happiness_score
)
```
