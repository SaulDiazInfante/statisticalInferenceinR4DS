# Simple Linear Regression

You’ll learn the basics of this popular statistical 
model, what regression is, and how linear and 
logistic regressions differ. You’ll then learn how to 
fit simple linear regression models with numeric and 
categorical explanatory variables, and how to 
describe the relationship between the response and 
explanatory variables using model coefficients.



## Visualizing two variables

Before you can run any statistical models,
it's usually a good idea to visualize your dataset. Here, we'll look at
the relationship between house price per area and the number of nearby
convenience stores, using the Taiwan real estate dataset.

One challenge in this dataset is that the number of convenience stores contains
integer data, causing points to overlap. To solve this, you will make the
points transparent.

`taiwan_real_estate` is available, `ggplot2` is loaded, and its black and 
white theme has been set.

- Using `taiwan_real_estate`, draw a scatter plot of `price_twd_msq` (y-axis) 
versus `n_convenience` (x-axis).
- Update the plot to make the points 50% transparent by setting alpha to 0.5.
- Update the plot by adding a trend line, calculated using a linear 
regression. You can omit the confidence ribbon.


```{.r filename="ex_0.r"}
ggplot(taiwan_real_estate, aes(n_convenience, price_twd_msq)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(
    method = 'lm',
    se = FALSE 
   )
```
