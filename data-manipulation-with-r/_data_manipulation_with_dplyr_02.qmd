## Counting by region

The `countie`s dataset contains columns for region, state, population, and the 
number of citizens, which we selected and saved as the `counties_selected` 
table. In this exercise, you'll focus on the region column.
```{.r code-line-numbers="false"}
counties_selected <- counties %>%
  select(county, region, state, population, citizens)    
```

### Intstructions `100 XP` {.unnumbered}

- Use `count()` to find the number of counties in each region, using a second 
argument to sort in descending order.

```{.r filename="ex_008.R"}
# Use count to find the number of counties in each region
counties_selected %>%
  count(region, sort = TRUE)
```

## Counting citizens by state
You can weigh your count by particular variables rather than finding the number 
of counties. In this case, you'll find the number of citizens in each state.

```{.r code-line-numbers="false"}
counties_selected <- counties %>%
  select(county, region, state, population, citizens)
```
### Instructions `100 XP` {.unnumbered}
Count the number of counties in each state, weighted based on the `citizens` 
column, and sorted in descending order.

```{.r filename="ex_009.R"}
# Find number of counties per state, weighted by citizens
counties_selected %>%
  count(state, wt=citizens, sort=TRUE)
```
