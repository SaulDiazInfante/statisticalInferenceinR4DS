-   Who I am. I am Saul Diaz Infante Velasco. I just starting as assistant
    professor at the Data Science graduate program of Universidad de Sonora at
    Hermosillo Mexico. My Background is related with numerical analysis and
    stochastic models. I'm are a enthusiastic of this treading topic called
    Data-Science, but perhaps at the moment I only have just intuition about
    what really it is. However, I have been programming almost 20 years an moved
    from old programming langues as FORTRAN, Pascal, Basic, Cobol, C, C++ to the
    new well established treading development workflows like R, Python and
    Julia. This is my firs attempt in R.
