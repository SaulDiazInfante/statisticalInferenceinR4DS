R programmers have a bad reputation writing bad code. Perhaps the main reason is
that the people whose write much of the package are not programmers but
scientific from other areas. Sometimes we overestimate crucial aspects from a
programming standpoint. As R programmers we overcome to write the code for
production. Mostly we write scripts and when we deploy it the same when we just
wrap it in a function and perhaps a package. It is common to face poorly written
code---**columns were referred by numbers, functions were dependent upon global
environment variables, 50+ lines functions without arguments and with over-sized
lines code 100 characters or more, not indentation, poor naming, conventions**
etc,...,.

We strongly encourage to use a style. Yea I know, there is not a unique way to
do it, but the philosophy is to follow a consistent style. With respect to this
regard made yourself a favor and read this great book for R
