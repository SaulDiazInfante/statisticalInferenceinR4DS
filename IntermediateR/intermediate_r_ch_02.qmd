# Loops

Loops can come in handy on numerous occasions. While loops are like repeated if
statements, the for loop is designed to iterate over all elements in a sequence.
Learn about them in this chapter.

## Write a while loop

Let's get you started with building a while loop from the ground up. Have 
another look at its recipe:

```{.r code-line-numbers="false"}
while (condition) {
  expr
}
```

Remember that the condition part of this recipe should become FALSE at some 
point during the execution. Otherwise, the while loop will go on indefinitely.

If your session expires when you run your code, check the body of your 
`while` loop carefully.

Have a look at the sample code provided; it initializes the `speed` variables 
and already provides a `while` loop template to get you started.

### Instructions `100 XP` {.unnumbered}

Code a while loop with the following characteristics:

- The condition of the while loop should check if speed is higher than 30.
- Inside the body of the while loop, print out "Slow down!".
- Inside the body of the while loop, decrease the speed by 7 units and assign  
this new value to speed again. This step is crucial; otherwise your while loop 
will never stop and your session will expire.

**If your session expires when you run your code, check the body of your while 
loop  carefully: it's likely that you made a mistake.**

```{.r filename="ex_012.R"}
# Initialize the speed variable
speed <- 64

# Code the while loop
while (speed >30) {
  print("Slow down!")
  speed <- speed - 7
}

# Print out the speed variable
speed
```

## Throw in more conditionals

In the previous exercise, you simulated the interaction between a driver and a 
driver's assistant: When the speed was too high, "Slow down!" got printed out to
the console, resulting in a decrease of your speed by 7 units.

There are several ways in which you could make your driver's assistant more 
advanced. For example, the assistant could give you different messages based on
your speed or provide you with a current speed at a given moment.

A while loop similar to the one you've coded in the previous exercise is already
available for you to use. It prints out your current speed, but there's no code 
that decreases the speed variable yet, which is pretty dangerous. Can you make 
the appropriate changes?

### Instructions 1`00 XP` {.unnumbered}

If the speed is greater than 48, have R print out "Slow down big time!", and 
decrease the speed by 11. Otherwise, have R simply print out "Slow down!", and
decrease the speed by 6. If the session keeps timing out and throwing an error,
you are probably stuck in an infinite loop! Check the body of your while loop 
and make sure you are assigning new values to speed.

```{.r filename="ex_013.R"}
# Initialize the speed variable
speed <- 64

# Extend/adapt the while loop
while (speed > 30) {
  print(paste("Your speed is",speed))
  if (speed > 48 ) {
    print("Slow down big time!")
    speed <- speed - 11 
  } else {
    print("Slow down!")
    speed <- speed - 6 
  }
}
```
## Stop the while loop: break
There are some very rare situations in which severe speeding is necessary: what
if a hurricane is approaching and you have to get away as quickly as possible?
You don't want the driver's assistant sending you speeding notifications in that
scenario, right?

This seems like a great opportunity to include the break statement in the while
loop you've been working on. Remember that the break statement is a control 
statement. When R encounters it, the while loop is abandoned completely.

### Instructions `100 XP` {.unnumbered}

Adapt the while loop such that it is abandoned when the speed of the vehicle is 
greater than 80. This time, the speed variable has been initialized to 88;
keep it that way.

```{.r  filename=ex_014.R}
# Initialize the speed variable
speed <- 88

while (speed > 30) {
  print(paste("Your speed is", speed))
  
  # Break the while loop when speed exceeds 80
  if (speed > 80) {
    break
  }
  
  if (speed > 48) {
    print("Slow down big time!")
    speed <- speed - 11
  } else {
    print("Slow down!")
    speed <- speed - 6
  }
}
```

## Build a while loop from scratch

The previous exercises guided you through developing a pretty advanced while 
loop, containing a break statement and different messages and updates as 
determined by control flow constructs. If you manage to solve this comprehensive
exercise using a while loop, you're totally ready for the next topic: the for 
loop.

## Instructions `100 XP` {.unnumbered}

Finish the while loop so that it:

- prints out the triple of i, so 3 * i, at each run.
- is abandoned with a break if the triple of i is divisible by 8, 
but still prints out this triple before breaking.

```{.r filename="ex_015.R"}
# Initialize i as 1 
i <- 1

# Code the while loop
while (i <= 10) {
  print(3 * i)
  if (i %% 8 ==0 ) {
    break
  }
  i <- i + 1
}
```
## Loop over a vector

In the previous video, Filip told you about two different strategies for using 
the for loop. To refresh your memory, consider the following loops that are 
equivalent in R:
```{.r code-line-numbers="false"}
primes <- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13)

# loop version 1
for (p in primes) {
  print(p)
}

# loop version 2
for (i in 1:length(primes)) {
  print(primes[i])
}
```

Remember our `linkedin` vector? It's a vector that contains the number of views
your LinkedIn profile had in the last seven days. The linkedin vector has been
pre-defined so that you can fully focus on the instructions!

### Instructions `100 XP` {.unnumbered}

Write a `for` loop that iterates over all the elements of `linkedin` and prints 
out every element separately. Do this in two ways: using the *loop version 1* 
and the *loop version 2* in the example code above.

```{.r filename="ex_016.R"}
# The linkedin vector has already been defined for you
linkedin <- c(16, 9, 13, 5, 2, 17, 14)

# Loop version 1
for (element in linkedin) {

    print(element)
}

# Loop version 2
for (i in 1:length(linkedin)){
    print(linkedin[i])
}
```

## Loop over a list

Looping over a list is just as easy and convenient as looping over a vector. 
There are again two different approaches here:

```{.r}
primes_list <- list(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13)

# loop version 1
for (p in primes_list) {
  print(p)
}

# loop version 2
for (i in 1:length(primes_list)) {
  print(primes_list[[i]])
}
```

Notice that you need double square brackets `- [[ ]] - ` to select the list 
elements in loop version 2.

Suppose you have a list of all sorts of information on New York City: its 
population size, the names of the boroughs, and whether it is the capital of the
United States. We've already defined a list nyc containing this information 
(source: Wikipedia).

### Instructions `100 XP` {.unnumbered}

As in the previous exercise, loop over the nyc list in two different ways to
print its elements:

- Loop directly over the nyc list (loop version 1).
- Define a looping index and do subsetting using double brackets 
(loop version 2).

```{.r filename="ex_017.R"}
# The nyc list is already specified
nyc <- list(pop = 8405837, 
            boroughs = c(
              "Manhattan",
              "Bronx",
              "Brooklyn",
              "Queens",
              "Staten Island"
            ), 
            capital = FALSE)

# Loop version 1
for(i in nyc){
    print(i)
}

# Loop version 2
for(i in 1:length(nyc)){
    print(nyc[[i]])
}
```
## Loop over a matrix

## Mix it up with control flow

## Next, you break it

## Build a for loop from scratch
