#  From epidemic to pandemicÂ¶
In December 2019, COVID-19 coronavirus was first identified in the Wuhan region of China. By March 11, 2020, the World
Health Organization (WHO) categorized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. A lot has happened in the months in between
with major outbreaks in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.

We know that COVID-19 spreads through respiratory droplets, such as through coughing, sneezing, or speaking. But,
how quickly did the virus spread across the globe? And, can we see any effect from country-wide policies, like
shutdowns and quarantines?

Fortunately, organizations around the world have been collecting data so that governments can monitor and learn from
this pandemic. Notably, the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering created a publicly
available data repository to consolidate this data from sources like the WHO, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), and the Ministry of Health from multiple countries.

In this notebook, you will visualize COVID-19 data from the first several weeks of the outbreak to see at what point
this virus became a global pandemic.

```{r}
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library("dplyr")
library(coronavirus)
update_dataset()
# Read datasets/confirmed_cases_worldwide.csv into confirmed_cases_worldwide
path <- getwd()
path <- file.path(path, "datasets", "confirmed_cases_worldwide.csv")
confirmed_cases_worldwide <- read_csv(path)
# See the result
confirmed_cases_worldwide



```
# Confirmed cases throughout the world
The table above shows the cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide by date.
Just reading numbers in a table makes it hard to get a sense of the scale and growth of
the outbreak. Let's draw a line plot to visualize the confirmed cases worldwide.

```{r }
# Draw a line plot of cumulative cases vs. date
# Label the y-axis
confirmed_cases_worldwide %>%
    ggplot(
        aes(
            x=date,
            y=cum_cases
        )
    ) +  geom_line() + ylab("Cumulative confirmed cases")


```
# China compared to the rest of the world
The y-axis in that plot is pretty scary, with the total number of confirmed cases
around the world
approaching 200,000. Beyond that, some weird things are happening: there is an odd jump
in mid February, then the rate of new cases slows down for a while, then speeds up
again in March. We need to dig deeper to see what is happening.

Early on in the outbreak, the COVID-19 cases were primarily centered in China. Let's
plot confirmed COVID-19 cases in China and the rest of the world separately to see if
it gives us any insight.

We'll build on this plot in future tasks. One thing that will be important for the
following tasks is that you add aesthetics within the line geometry of your ggplot,
rather than making them global aesthetics.

```{r}
# Read in datasets/confirmed_cases_china_vs_world.csv
path <- file.path(wd_path, "datasets", "confirmed_cases_china_vs_world.csv")
confirmed_cases_china_vs_world <- read_csv(path)

# See the result
glimpse(confirmed_cases_china_vs_world)
# Draw a line plot of cumulative cases vs. date, colored by is_china
# Define aesthetics within the line geom
plt_cum_confirmed_cases_china_vs_world <-
  ggplot(
    data = confirmed_cases_china_vs_world) +
  geom_line(
    aes(
      x = date,
      y = cum_cases,
      color = is_china
    )
  ) +
  ylab("Cumulative confirmed cases")

# See the plot
plt_cum_confirmed_cases_china_vs_world
```
# Let's annotate!

Wow! The two lines have very different shapes. In February, the majority of cases were
in China. That changed in March when it really became a global outbreak: around March
14, the total number of cases outside China overtook the cases inside China. This was
days after the WHO declared a pandemic.

There were a couple of other landmark events that happened during the outbreak. For
example, the huge jump in the China line on February 13, 2020 wasn't just a bad day
regarding the outbreak; China changed the way it reported figures on that day (CT
scans were accepted as evidence for COVID-19, rather than only lab tests).

By annotating events like this, we can better interpret changes in the plot.
