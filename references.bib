abstract = { ABSTRACT
  Introductory statistical inference texts and courses treat the point
  estimation, hypothesis testing, and interval estimation problems separately,
  with primary emphasis on large-sample approximations. Here, I present an
  alternative approach to teaching this course, built around p-values,
  emphasizing provably valid inference for all sample sizes.
  Details about computation and marginalization are also provided,
  with several illustrative examples, along with a course outline.
  Supplementary materials for this article are available online. }
