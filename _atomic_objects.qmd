At the R console, any executable typed text that we put a side of the prompt are
called expressions. We start by the $\texttt{<-}$ symbol is the assignment
operator.

```{r }
  x <- 0
  print(x)
  x
  msg <- "what's up"
  msg
```

The `[1]` shown in the output indicates that `x` is a 
`vector` and 0 is the element at position with `index` 1.
